# nuXmv Examples
A collection of timed and untimed _nuXmv_ models that I have created while learning the tool.

## Dependencies
- _nuXmv_.
- To use the script [./run.sh](./run.sh), a symlink to the _nuXmv_ binary, or the binary itself must be located at `./nuXmv`

## Basic Usage
`./run.sh <model.smv> [options]`: initialize model and check its specifications.

Options:
- `-v` verbose, show all output when checking properties on timed models
